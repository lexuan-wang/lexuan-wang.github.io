**Welcome to My Academic Profile!**

I am an Associate Professor at the Communication University of China and Executive Director of the Institute of International Studies. 

My scholarship explores the dynamic interplay between communication systems and global power structures, with particular attention to international political communication, media and global governance, norm contestation, and the diplomatic strategies of China and Russia.

Three central inquiries guide my current work: First, I examine how sovereign states and international organizations strategically employ communication tools—from public diplomacy to disinformation campaigns—to shape political narratives and influence public opinion. Second, I investigate how states mobilize discursive and institutional resources to redefine international norms and reconstruct behavioral expectations in our rapidly evolving multipolar world. Third, I analyze how visual representations not merely reflect but actively construct meaning in international politics, thereby shaping the very architecture of global relations.

I particularly welcome engagement with graduate students seeking supervision and fellow scholars pursuing projects at the nexus of political communication and international studies. My research appears in leading journals including Chinese Journal of International Politics, Europe-Asia Studies, and Discourse & Communication, and I contribute editorial expertise to Politics and Governance as a special issue editor.

My current portfolio includes directing multiple funded research initiatives while teaching core courses in International Politics and Diplomatic Studies. This work builds on my academic training: a Ph.D. from the University of Warwick, a Franco-Chinese dual master's degree from Sciences Po Paris and Fudan University, and an undergraduate education in International Relations at Fudan.
